# Improvements

## <s>Re-run the `_steps.ipynb` files</s>

<s>Re-run the `_steps.ipynb` files; this time increase the number of evaluation episodes to 1000 timesteps. Hopefully that will reduce the chance that the agent just performs luckily in the early stages.

That way plot would be more pleasant to look at and also more intuitive to explain.</s>

Tried it; didn't matter, but took ages to run.

Maybe instead try to save the model more frequently.
Remember to re-run the evaluation and visualisation too and modify the README. <mark>done</mark>

## Move learn+save code in utility file
