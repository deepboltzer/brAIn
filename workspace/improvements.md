# Improvements

## Re-run the `_steps.ipynb` files

Re-run the `_steps.ipynb` files; this time increase the nubmer of evaluation episodes to 1000 timesteps. Hopefully that will reduce the chance that the agent just performs luckily in the early stages.

That way plot would be more pleasant to look at and also more intuitive to explain.
