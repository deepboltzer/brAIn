Both algoithms learn the action-value function $Q(s, a)$ in order to find the best policy possible. Once $Q(s, a)$ has been learned and optimized, the policy $\\pi(a | s)$ can be derived by greedily chosing the best action $a$ leading to the highest value of $Q(s, a)$ when in state $s$.\n"

    "Both algorithms we look at today utilize **Temporal-Difference (TD)** Learning. TD-Learning that either the action-value function $Q(s, a)$ or the value funtion $V(s)$ are improved by shifting the existing function acording to the observed experiences. In this, TD-Learning shares some similiarties with stochastic gradient descent (SGD) as employed in neural networks, seeing as in each iteration SGD slightly shifts the parameters to gradually improve the neural network performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each TD-Learning step considers a sequence $s_t, a_t, r_{t+1}, s_{t+1}, a_{t+1}$ from a trajectory $\\tau$ at a timestep $t$. Further a hyperparameter $\\alpha \\in (0, 1)$ is needed and the discount of future rewards $\\gamma$ has to be taken into condieration. TD-Learning shifts the existing function according to the **TD target** given by $r_{t+1} + \\gamma V(s_{t+1})$ or $r_{t+1} + \\gamma Q(s_{t+1}, a_{t+1})$ respectively, which estimates the function in the observed trajectory:\n",
